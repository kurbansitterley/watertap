Seawater RO Desalination
========================

Introduction
------------

This flowsheet represents a full-scale seawater reverse osmosis treatment facility.
The flowsheet includes pretreatment, desalination, post-treatment, and waste handling unit processes available in WaterTAP.
Unit models used on this flowsheet span the spectrum from simple (zero order models *add link*) to complex (reverse osmosis).
This flowsheet includes examples of several different types of modeling features available in WaterTAP, including:

* Zero order models
* Zero order property package
* Reverse osmosis and pump models
* Sodium chloride property package
* Translator blocks
* WaterTAP costing package
* Zero order costing package
* Unit model costing packages
* WaterTAP database
* Several base IDAES models
